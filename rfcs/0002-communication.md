# Summary

Our communication is sustainable, efficient, transparent, and concise. We use GitHub Issues/Discussions along with our RFC process (RFC-0001). The core team meets in a video call every two months.

# Motivation

Good communication within a working group is essential. Because the core team members are busy with their day jobs, communication needs to be as well defined, efficient, and focused as possible.

# Detailed design

Our communication is:

1. **Sustainable**: Core members should not be overwhelmed and should be able
to do their work consistently over a long period.
2. **Efficient**: It shouldn't take much effort and it shouldn't require repetition due to lack of structure.
3. **Transparent**: Everyone should be able to clearly see decisions origins, feature motivations, and future plans. This will reduce the need for support and questions, so that the team can focus on implementations.
4. **Concise**: Omit needless words. Unambiguous communication does not need to be overly verbose.

Based on these requirements, we define the following communication methods:

1. Our main channel for helping people is **GitHub Issues**. It is the ubiquitous industry standard.
2. For open ended threaded discussions, we use **GitHub Discussions**. This allows us to easily cross-reference PRs, Issues, and Discussions.
3. We follow the RFC process defined in **RFC-0001** for features, breaking changes, etc.
4. For issues that can turn into RFCs, CWWG members encourage the community to create an RFC. We hope that this motivates newcomers to contribute.
5. In order to keep vision aligned, the core team should meet every two months.
These meetings cover:
    - Current state of the CWWG.
    - Progress within last period.
    - Reviewing RFCs. Prioritizing their implementations.
    - Reviewing community feedback.
    - Planning for the next period.
    - Reviewing tasks and creating a clear milestone to achieve before the next meeting.  
6. For chatting, quick discussions, and ideas, the Telegram group can be used. Note that
requesting new features and introducing big changes should not be done in the Telegram group.
Issues, Discussions, and RFCs are already serving that purpose.

We expect core members of the CWWG to be active in all of the channels mentioned above.

# Drawbacks

- Once the community gets more involved, meeting every two months may not be sufficient.
- The community may prefer to have a Discord for unstructured communication, but we believe that this does not align with our requirements. We may create one later.


# Alternatives

- Other platforms like Discord, Slack, Matrix, etc. can also be used for communication. However, these do not satisfy our efficiency and transparency requirements. We also think that they are not structured enough.
