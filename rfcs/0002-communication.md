# Summary

Core members of CWWG need a well-defined, efficient, and asynchronous way to
communicate with each other.

# Motivation

Communicating well in a working group like this is essential since this group
consists of diverse teams and people from all around the world. Also, since
the core team members can be very busy with their day-to-day jobs, ways of
communication should be well defined and efficient as possible.

# Detailed design

1. Core team will work with 2 months long periods. Every 2 months, they will have
a meeting regarding:
  - The things that have been done until now.
  - Active RFC's overview and planning for the next period.
  - Reviewing of the feedbacks from Twitter, issues, or any other platforms.

2. During a 2 month period, core team members should be active on issues, PR reviews
and RFC discussions. CWWG will be helping people through issues asynchronously.

3. For setting up the meetings and additional chats, telegram will be used.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on teaching people about the CWWG
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Adoption strategy

Will this RFC introduce breaking changes of any kind? If so, how will we facilitate migrations?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
